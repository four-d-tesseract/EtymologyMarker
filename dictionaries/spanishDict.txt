It is a list of [[English language]] words whose origin can be traced to the [[Spanish language]] as "Spanish [[loan word]]s". Many of them are identical in other [[Romance language]]s (mainly Portuguese or Italian), but their passage into English is believed to be through Spanish.

Most these words came to English from Castilian and American [[Spanish dialects]], which in turn got them from various sources including English ("turista").
