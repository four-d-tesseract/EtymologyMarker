The number of [[English language|English]] words known to be derived from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic language]] is remarkably small. In fact, as far as can be ascertained it is lower than the number of [[List of English words of Gaulish origin|words of Gaulish origin]] found in the English language, which arrived through Norman French. However, this is to be expected, given the socio-historical relationship between [[Old English]] and Brittonic; the influence of the Brittonic language has been more prominent in other areas such as syntax.<ref>Tristram, Hildegaard 2007: "Why Don't the English Speak Welsh" [http://www.hildegard.tristram.de/media/tristram_manchester_30-07-07.pdf <The Paper>], retrieved Mar.1, 2014.</ref> However, it is possible that many British words have been obscured by their close similarity to Germanic words which are perceived to offer a more likely etymology (e.g. "belly": considered to be from OE ''bylg'', but could easily be from AB ''*belgā''), and also that some of them have been misidentified as [[List of French words of Gaulish origin|Gaulish via French]], which are simply unattested until after the Norman invasion.

==Other sources of Celtic words in English==
This list does not include words of Celtic origin borrowed into English from other languages, namely:
*Later [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]: [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (e.g. "coracle, flannel"), [[Cornish language|Cornish]] (e.g. "wrasse", possibly "gull"), [[Breton language|Breton]] (e.g. "dolmen, menhir"), or others unknown ("gull" ?).
*[[Gaelic (language)|Gaelic]] (e.g. "keening, bog, bother, hubbub, glen, clan", possibly ''gob'')
*[[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] (via Norman French or [[Latin]]: "ambassador, bound, car, carpenter, piece," etc. and possibly "beak, bran, flannel, gallon," etc.)
*Gaulish or similar Indo-European via early Germanic (e.g. "down"<ref>Douglas Harper, "Online Etymology Dictionary" - [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=down down (n.2)], retrieved Mar. 1, 2014.</ref>), or Gaulish or Gallo-Latin via early Germanic ("bin"<ref>Douglas Harper, "Online Etymology Dictionary" - [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bin bin (n.)], retrieved Mar. 1, 2014.</ref>)
unless there is room for doubt.

The Modern Irish word for woman is ''bean'' /bæn/ and ''síd(h)'' (or ''sí'' in modern spelling) is an Irish term referring to a 'fairy mound'. (See [[Sidhe]].)

==Place-name terminology==
[[File:KilmarnockJohnFinnieStreet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Kilmarnock]]]]

There are numerous additional place-name elements in Scotland which are derived from Gaelic, but the majority of these has not entered the English or Scots language as productive nouns and often remain opaque to the average Scot. A few examples of such elements are:

*a(u)ch- from Gaelic ''achadh'', a field; hence [[Auchentoshan]], [[Auchinleck]]
*ard- from Gaelic ''àird'', a height or promontory; hence [[Ardnamurchan]], etc.
*bal- from Gaelic ''baile'', a town; hence [[Balgowan, Dundee|Balgowan]], [[Balgay]] etc.
*dal- from Gaelic ''dail'', a meadow (not to be confused with "dale", from the Norse ''dalr'' meaning a valley); hence [[Dalry (disambiguation)|Dalry]]
*drum- from Gaelic ''druim'', a ridge; hence [[Drumchapel]], [[Drumnadrochit]] etc.
*dun- from Gaelic ''dun'', a fort; hence [[Dundee]], [[Dumbarton]], Dunedin/[[Edinburgh]]
*inver- from Gaelic ''inbhir'', a river mouth or confluence; hence [[Inverclyde]], [[Inverleith]]
*kil- from Gaelic ''cill'', a churchyard; hence [[Kilmarnock]], [[Kilbride (disambiguation)|Kilbride]] etc.
*kin- from Gaelic ''ceann'', a head; hence [[Kinlochleven]], [[Kinloss]] etc.

{{Wiktionary|Category:English terms derived from Welsh}}

This is a list of [[English language]] words of [[Welsh language]] origin. As with the Goidelic languages, the Brythonic tongues are close enough for possible derivations from [[Cumbric]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] or [[Breton language|Breton]] in some cases.

Beyond the loan of common nouns, there are numerous English toponyms, surnames, personal names or nicknames derived from Welsh (see [[Celtic toponymy]], [[Celtic onomastics]]).<ref>Max Förster ''Keltisches Wortgut im Englischen'', 1921, cited by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[English and Welsh]]'', 1955. "many 'English' surnames, ranging from the rarest to the most familiar, are linguistically derived from Welsh (or British), from place-names, patronymics, personal names, or nick-names; or are in part so derived, even when that origin is no longer obvious. Names such as Gough, Dewey, Yarnal, Merrick, Onions, or Vowles, to mention only a few."

==Words that derive from Welsh==
[[File:Cardigan Welsh Corgi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Welsh Corgi]]
<!-- Please cite a documented etymology before adding words to this list.  If you don't have one, put them on the talk page and someone will look them up.  Thanks! NB: OED is a SUBSCRIPTION site. Please do not link to subscription sites. -->
; avon : from Welsh ''afon''; Cornish ''avon''
; [[bara brith|barabrith]] : from ''bara brith'' (speckled bread) a contemptuous term for the English.
; [[bard]] : from Old Celtic ''bardos'', either through Welsh ''bardd'' (where the bard was highly respected) or Scottish ''bardis'' (where it was a term of contempt); Cornish ''bardh''
; [[cawl]] : a traditional Welsh soup/stew; Cornish ''kowl''
; [[coracle]] : from ''corwgl''.  But this Welsh term was derived from the Latin ''corium'' meaning "leather or hide", the material from which coracles are made. <ref>[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=corium&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>
; [[Welsh Corgi|corgi]] : from ''cor'', "dwarf" + ''gi'' ([[soft mutation]] of ''ci''), "dog".
; [[cliff|crag]] : from an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] source, perhaps from Welsh ''craig'or 'Carreg''.;<ref name=ErnestWeekley1921 /><ref name =WalterSkeat /> Cornish ''karrek'' 
; [[cromlech]] : from ''crom llech'' literally "crooked flat stone"
; [[cwm (landform)|cwm]]
: from ''cwm'' "coomb." Cornish; ''komm''; passed into Old English as 'cumb'
; [[dad]] : from Welsh ''tad''. From a common Proto-Indo-European root used in many other languages, but almost certainly entered English from Welsh as the Old English equivalent was ''fæder'' (father) from Proto-Germanic ''fader'' Cornish; ''tas''
; [[eisteddfod]] :  from Welsh, lit. "session," from eistedd "to sit" (from sedd "seat," cognate with L. sedere; see sedentary) + bod "to be" (cognate with O.E. beon; see be).<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=eisteddfod&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>
; [[flannel]] : the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] says the etymology is "uncertain", but Welsh ''gwlanen''  = "flannel wool" is likely.   An alternative source is Old French ''flaine'', "blanket". The word has been adopted in most European languages. An earlier English form was ''flannen'', which supports the Welsh etymology. Shakspeare's [[The Merry Wives of Windsor]] contains the term "the Welsh flannel".<ref name = ErnestWeekley1921>{{Citation | url = http://www.archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/ | title = An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English | first = Ernest | last = Weekley | year = 1921}}.</ref><ref name=WalterSkeat>{{Citation | url = http://www.archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft | title = An Etymological Dictionary the English Language | first = Walter W | last = Skeat | year = 1888}}.</ref>
; [[flummery]] : from ''llymru''<ref name=ErnestWeekley1921 /><ref name=WalterSkeat />
; [[hiraeth]] :  homesickness tinged with grief or sadness over the lost or departed. It is a mix of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness, or an earnest desire.
; [[kistvaen]] : from ''[[cist]]'' (chest) and ''maen'' (stone).
; [[wikt:lech|lech]] : from ''llech.''<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lech | contribution = Lech}}.</ref>
; possibly [[penguin]] : Possibly from ''pen gwyn'', "white head". "The fact that the penguin has a black head is no serious objection."<ref name=ErnestWeekley1921 /><ref name=WalterSkeat /> It may also be derived from the [[Breton language]], or the [[Cornish Language]], which are all closely related.  However, dictionaries suggest the derivation is from [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen'' "head" and ''gwyn'' "white", including the [[Oxford English Dictionary]],<ref name = "OED">[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50174529?query_type=word&queryword=penguin&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=e9qK-031OnY-14734&hilite=50174529 Oxford English Dictionary]. Accessed 2007-03-21</ref> the [[American Heritage Dictionary]],<ref name = "AHD">[http://www.wordnik.com/words/penguin/etymology American Heritage Dictionary at wordnik.com] Accessed 2010-01-25</ref> the [[Century Dictionary]]<ref name = "Century Dictionary">[http://www.wordnik.com/words/penguin/etymology Century Dictionary at wordnik.com] Accessed 2010-01-25</ref> and [[Merriam-Webster]],<ref name = "MW">[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/penguin Merriam-Webster] Accessed 2010-01-25</ref> on the basis that the name was originally applied to the [[great auk]], which had white spots in front of its eyes (although its head was black). ''Pen gwyn'' is identical in Cornish and in Breton. An alternative etymology links the word to Latin ''pinguis'', which means "fat". In Dutch, the alternative word for penguin is "fat-goose" (vetgans see: Dutch wiki or dictionaries under Pinguïn), and would indicate this bird received its name from its appearance.
; tref : meaning “hamlet, home, town.”;<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tref | contribution = Tref}}.</ref> Cornish ''tre''.
; [[wrasse]] : a kind of sea fish (derived via Cornish ''wrach'', Welsh ''gwrach'' (meaning hag or witch)).<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wrasse | contribution = Wrasse}}.</ref>

==Words that derive from Cornish==
; [[Bal]]: mine as in [[Balmaiden]] or [[Hemerdon Mine|Hemerdon Bal]] in Devon
; [[Brill (fish)|brill]] (possibly) : from Cornish ''brilli'', "mackerel".<ref name=ErnestWeekley1921 />
; [[dolmen]] : from Cornish and/or Breton ''taolvaen'', ''taol'', "table"  and ''maen'', "stone".
; [[fogou]] : from [[Cornish language|Cornish]] underground structure [[souterrain]] which is found in many [[Iron Age]] settlements in [[Cornwall]]. The purpose of a fogou is no longer known, and there is little evidence to suggest what it might have been.
; [[Fossicking]] : a form of prospecting
; perhaps [[Gull]] :Welsh ''gwylan'', Cornish ''guilan'', Breton ''goelann''<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/</ref>
; [[paw]]: paw, claw, figuratively hand; padgy-paw dialectal newt or lizard 'four-paw'<ref>https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24826762M/The_ancient_language_and_the_dialect_of_Cornwall</ref> (Pawen in Welsh)
; [[Porbeagle]] : a species of fish.
; possibly [[Puffin]] : a type of bird.
; [[Tiddy oggy]]; another term for pasties.
; [[vug]], '''vugg''', '''vugh''' : from Cornish ''vooga'', "cave".
; [[Wrasse]] : a type of fish.

Many dialect words in the [[Westcountry dialects|West-Cornish dialect]] of [[English language|English]] are from the [[Cornish language]] itself, however these words are localised to [[Cornwall|West Cornwall]] and therefore it would not be accurate to describe them as having passed into English "proper".

==Words that derive from Breton==
All Breton-origin words in English come by way of French.

; [[wikt:Special:Search/bijou|bijou]] : from Breton ''bizoù'' ring (''biz'' means finger)
; [[gull]] : from ''[[wikt:gouelan#Breton|gouelan]]'' (''gouelañ'' means to cry)
; [[Jewell (surname)|Jewell]] : (surname) from Judicaël (''iud'' means combatant then lord and ''hael'' means generous or magnanimous)
; [[korrigan]] : from 'dwarf' (diminutive)
; [[menhir]] : from Breton ''maen'' stone and ''hir'' "long" / "tall", i.e. a "long stone" ([[wikt:main#Welsh|main]] [[wikt:hir#Welsh|hir]] also means long, slender in Welsh)
; [[truant]] : from Breton ''truan'' (miserable, vagabond, beggar, rogue, villain)

==Words with indirect or possible links==
[[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] origins for the topographical terms [[Tor (geography)|Tor]] (OW ''tŵr'') and [[cliff|crag]] (OW ''carreg'' or ''craig'') are among a number of available Celtic derivations for the Old English antecedents to the modern terms.  However, the existence of similar cognates in both the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]], [[Latin]], [[Old French]] and the other [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] families makes isolation of a precise origin difficult, such as for example, the adoption of the word ''Cross'' from Latin ''Crux'', Old Irish ''cros'', OE ''Rood'' ;  appearing in Welsh and Cornish as ''Croes'', ''Grows''.

; '''Adder''': The Proto-Indo-European root ''netr-'' led to Latin ''natrix'', Welsh ''neidr'', West Germanic ''nædro'', Old Norse ''naðra'', Middle Dutch ''nadre'', any of which may have led to the English word.
; '''Bow''': May be from Old English ''bugan'' "to bend, to bow down, to bend the body in condescension," also "to turn back", or more simply from the Welsh word ''bwa''
; '''Coombe''': meaning "valley", is usually linked with the Welsh ''cwm'', also meaning "valley".  However, the OED traces both words back to an earlier Celtic word, *''kumbos''.  It suggests a direct [[Old English]] derivation for "coombe".
::(Coumba, or coumbo, is the common western-alpine vernacular word for "glen", and considered genuine gaulish (celtic-ligurian branch). Found in many toponyms of the western Alps like Coumboscuro (Grana valley), Bellecombe and Coumbafréide (Aoste), Combette (Suse), Coumbal dou Moulin (Valdensian valleys). Although seldom used, the word "combe" is included into major standard-french dictionaries. This could justify the celtic origin thesis).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
; '''[[Crockery]]'''
: It has been suggested that '''crockery''' might derive from the Welsh ''crochan'', as well as the Manx ''crocan'' and Gaelic ''crogan'', meaning "pot".  The OED states that this view is "undetermined".  It suggests that the word derives from Old English ''croc'', via the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''krukka'', meaning "an earthenware pot or pitcher".
;'''[[Crumpet]]''': Welsh ''crempog'' Cornish or Breton ''Krampoez''; 'little hearth cakes'
; '''[[Druid]]''': From the Old Celtic ''derwijes''/''derwos'' ("true knowledge" or literally "they who know the oak") from which the modern Welsh word ''derwydd'' evolved, but travelled to English through Latin (''druidae'') and French (''druide'')
;'''[[Gull]]''': from either Welsh or Cornish;<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gull&allowed_in_frame=0 | contribution = Gull}}.</ref> Welsh ''gwylan'', Cornish ''guilan'', Breton ''goelann''; all from O.Celt. *voilenno- "gull" (OE ''mæw'')
;'''[[Pig|Hog]]''': Cornish ''Hogh'' (and [[hedgehog]])
;'''[[Iron]]''': or at least the modern form of the word "iron" (c/f Old English ''ísern'', proto-Germanic ''*isarno'', itself borrowed from proto-Celtic), appears to have been influenced by pre-existing Celtic forms in the British Isles: Old Welsh ''hearn'', Cornish ''hoern'', Old Gaelic ''íarn'' (Irish ''iaran'', ''iarun'', Scottish ''iarunn'')<ref>{{Citation | title = OED | contribution = Iron}}.</ref>
;'''[[Lawn]]''': from Welsh ''Llan''  Cornish ''Lan'' (cf. [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], Breton ''Lann''); Heath; enclosed area of land, grass about a [[Christian]] site of worship from Cornish Lan (e.g. [[Lanteglos-by-Fowey|Lanteglos]], occasionally Laun as in Launceston) or Welsh Llan (e.g. [[Llandewi]])<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lawn&allowed_in_frame=0 | contribution = Lawn}}.</ref>
;'''[[Penguin]]''': From ''pen gwyn'' meaning ''white-head ''from either Welsh, Cornish or Breton<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=penguin&searchmode=none | contribution = Penguin}}.</ref> An alternative etymology links the word to Latin ''pinguis'', which means "fat". In Dutch, the alternative word for penguin is "fat-goose" (vetgans see: Dutch wiki or dictionaries under Pinguïn), and would indicate this bird received its name from its appearance.

;'''[[Tor (rock formation)|Tor]]''': meaning hill or mountain, possibly via Latin ''turris'' (tower) such as [[Glastonbury Tor]], is particularly prevalent in [[Devon]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Etymology online | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Tor&searchmode=none | contribution = Tor}}.</ref>
